Obtained an MSc in Computer Science (Data Science & Technology track) and BSc
in Computer Science & Engineering from Delft University of Technology. Served as
 TA for numerous undergraduate and graduate courses in
Computer Science. Named Member of Merit of the study association of Computer
Science and served as President of the Student Council at the Faculty of
Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science and the IT Committee of
my student association.

I hope to one day leverage my technology background to realize the implementation
of advanced technologies. In the end, I am much more interested in how technology
can impact people's lives than just technology by itself. Specifically I am
interested in how we can use state of the art solutions to tackle climate issues,
gain insights into the brain and the nature of consciousness, realizing the
exploration and colonization of space and to end poverty and hunger.

I am also an avid golfer, having competed at national level and ranked as one of
the top 30 golfers on the Dutch amateur Order of Merit in 2013.
