"Hello, world" is a phrase known to most programmers around the world.
A program that prints out this phrase is usually the first program that one would
create when learning a new programming language. In fact, it is that common that
this phenomenon has its own [Wikipedia page][hello-world-wiki]. These programs
don't serve that much practical use, but are usually used to demonstrate syntax
and as a sanity check to verify proper installation. Despite this, I still vividly
remember the first time I wrote such a program and the sheer thrill that I had made a computer
do such a thing. Up to this very, it still always feels like a little bit of magic to me.

I understand the link between these two topics might be a bit of stretch for most
readers, but allow me to elaborate. It boils down to the two reasons why I have decided
to start writing this blog. The first reason is that I want to become familiar with
a new way of expressing my ideas in the form of blogging. By practicing this
regularly, I hope to become a better writer. While studying Computer Science, I found
that this is a skill that is severely overlooked among Engineering students. What is the use of a great idea that one cannot communicate concisely.
Or as Nelson Mandela once put it: "A good head and good heart are always a formidable combination. But when you add to that a literate tongue or pen, then you have something very special".

The second reason would be that blogging allows me to share my thoughts with the
world and to allow people to become familiar with some of my past and current projects.
I am passionate about a wide range of topics


Well, I guess this is: Hello, World!
