"Hello, world" is a phrase known to almost every programmer in the world.
A program that prints out this phrase is usually the first program that one
would create when learning to program or try out a new programming language. In
fact, it is that common that this phenomenon has its own
[Wikipedia page][hello-world-wiki]. These programs don't serve that much
practical use, but are usually used to demonstrate syntax and as a sanity check
to verify proper installation. Despite this, I still vividly remember the first
time I wrote such a program and the sheer thrill that I had made a computer do
such a thing. Up to this very, it still always feels like a little bit of magic
to me.

Outside of programming, the phrase is well known among golfers after one of my
heroes, golfer Tiger Woods, used it to introduce himself upon his professional
debut. Although Tiger did not play that great in this specific tournament (
although he did make a hole-in-one), his success in the early stages of his
career have made this moment an iconic piece of golfing history.

I understand the link between these two topics might be a bit of stretch for
most readers, but allow me to elaborate. It boils down to the two reasons why I
have decided to start writing this blog. The first reason is that I want to
become familiar with a new way of expressing my ideas in the form of blogging.
By practicing this regularly, I hope to become a better writer. While studying
Computer Science, I found that this is a skill that is severely overlooked among
Engineering students. Having great ideas isn't all that useful if you cannot
communicate them adequately. Or as Nelson Mandela once put it a little bit more
eloquently: "A good head and good heart are always a formidable combination.
But when you add to that a literate tongue or pen, then you have something very
special".

The second reason would be that blogging allows me to share my thoughts with the
world and to allow people to become familiar with some of my past and current
projects. Not only do I thoroughly enjoy learning about new things, sharing
this newly gained knowledge is almost equally as rewarding.
An extra practical argument for doing this, is that this blog serves
as a portfolio of sorts. 


Well then, I guess this is: Hello, World!

Cheers,
Felix
